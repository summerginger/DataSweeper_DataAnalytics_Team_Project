### [Team communication protocols](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NugbKt5vuU91jPWE3nzVjTbBYoNdhf9_9ET2l-FNRmI/edit?usp=sharing)

This week, each team member will choose a shape, with each shape responsible for a specific task. The shapes to choose from are square, circle, triangle, and X. We will also use whatsapp,slack,Github project and google docs tool for communiction.
