            <h2>Overview of the Project</h2>
            <p1 class="center" >The objective of this project is to help a financial institution to decide whether to issue a credit card to an applicant. 
              Using personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants, the model will predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings.
              The decision of approving a credit card is mainly dependent on the personal and financial background of the applicant. 
              Factors like, age, gender, income, employment status, 
              
              credit history and other attributes all carry weight in the approval decision.
        
              Credit analysis focus on recognizing, assessing and reducing the financial or other risks that could lead to loss involved in the transaction.
              <img align="right" style="width:500px;" src="images/card.jpg">
              <br>There are two basic risks:
              
              <li>Business loss that results from not approving the good candidate.</li>
             
              <li>Financial loss that results from by approving a non-credit worthy candidate.</li>
              
              It is very important to manage credit risk and handle challenges efficiently for credit decision as it can have adverse effects on credit management.
            </p1>
            <h2>Topic Selection Criteria </h2>
            <p1>In today's fast-paced and high-tech world, credit scores can further impact many financial transactions, 
              including personal loans, auto loans, mortgages, and credit cards. Credit scoring is a standard method of risk control in the financial industry. It uses the personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to assess their creditworthiness. 
              To prenet its losses, the financial institution has a responsibility to control and objectively quantify the magnitude of risk and credit card issuance.
              The primary objective of this analysis is to implement the data mining techniques on a credit card applicant dataset. Data-based conclusions about probability of repayment can be derived and recommendations can be put forward.
              <br>
              Datasets will be cleaned and analysed so that they can be used in multiple machine learning models. Following the results and information derived from the different models,
              recommendations will be provided so the financial institution can choose which model to use.
